## Which Honeypot(s) you deployed:
	• Dionaea
	• Snort
	• Kippo
## Any issues you encountered:
	• The only issue I encountered was getting the MHN Server to load. When clicking the link from within the Google console it loads the vm with https. 
	• Couldn’t get the console to work as stated in the directions… I used the cloud shell to complete the assignment
	• Because I used the cloud shell, I couldn’t figure out how to download the session.json. I downloaded the file using Winscp
	• I received and error stating that my vm was over utilized, when I followed the suggestion… my admin console changed ip address and lost connection with the honey pots.
